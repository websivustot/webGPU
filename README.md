# WebGPU test

The WebGPU API enables web developers to use the underlying system's GPU (Graphics Processing Unit) to carry out high-performance computations and draw complex images that can be rendered in the browser.

For example, WebLLM is a high-performance in-browser LLM inference engine that brings language model inference directly onto web browsers with hardware acceleration. This model requires WebGPU extension shader-f16, which can be missing on some computers.

Use this way to check and inform to your users instead to get error.
